# The Aether

The Aether is, at its core, a MUD that runs on top of Discord.

However, what separates The Aether from other discord roleplaying games (such as Discord RPG, which is arguably a great game on its own) is that by playing it you are a true participant in the world.

While other discord bots control traveling in a 2-dimensional way (you can play without ever leaving a channel, and other participants can be in the same chanel as you), The Aether controls traveling in a 3-dimensional way through the world by managing the roles and permissions that define Discord. That is to say, when you travel "north" from a room, for example, roles are assigned and revoked from your account with varying permissions that emulate the feeling of actually moving to a different location.
