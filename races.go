		"-Catfolk\n": "-Catfolk are a race of natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such trailblazing is not limited merely to the search for new horizons in distant lands. " +
			"Many catfolk see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. While most catfolk are nimble, capable, and often active creatures, " +
			"there is also a strong tendency among some catfolk to engage in quiet contemplation and study.",

		"-Clockwork\n": "-You are a clockwork representation of a given race. Your shape and size are obviously of that race, but you are double the weight. " +
			"Clockwork rarely share the same hair, skin, or eye color as the race they are modeled after. You are obviously built entirely out of mechanical parts.\n",

		"-Dwarf\n": "-These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen as stern and humorless. Known for mining the earthâ€™s treasures and crafting magnificent " +
			"items from ore and gemstones, " +
			"they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties of the deep earth. Dwarves also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation that sometimes manifests as xenophobia.",

		"-Elf\n": "-Tall, noble, and often haughty, elves are long-lived and subtle masters of the wilderness. Elves excel in the arcane arts. Often they use their intrinsic link to nature to " +
			"forge new spells and create wondrous items that, like their creators, seem nearly impervious to the ravages of time. A private and often introverted race, " +
			"elves can give the impression they are indifferent to the plights of others.",

		"-Halfing\n": "-Members of this diminutive race find strength in family, community, and their own innate and seemingly inexhaustible luck. " +
			"While their fierce curiosity is sometimes at odds with their intrinsic common sense, half lings are eternal optimists and cunning opportunists with an incredible knack " +
			"for getting out the worst situations.",

		"-Half-Elf\n": "-Often caught between the worlds of their progenitor races, half-elves are a race of both grace and contradiction. " +
			"Their dual heritage and natural gifts often create brilliant diplomats and peacemakers, but half-elves are often susceptible " +
			"to an intense and even melancholic isolation, realizing that they are never truly part of elven or human society.",

		"-Half-Orc\n": "-Often fierce and savage, sometimes noble and resolute, half-orcs can manifest the best and worst qualities of their parent races. " +
			"Many half-orcs struggle to keep their more bestial natures in check in order to epitomize the most heroic values of humanity. Unfortunately, " +
			"many outsiders see half-orcs as hopeless abominations devoid of civility, if not monsters unworthy of pity or parley.",

		"-Human\n": "-Ambitious, sometimes heroic, and always confident, humans have an ability to work together toward common goals that makes them a force to be reckoned with. " +
			"Though short-lived compared to other races, their boundless energy and drive allow them to accomplish much in their brief lifetimes.",

		"-Kobold\n": "-Kobolds are weak, craven, and seethe with a festering resentment for the rest of the world, especially members of races that seem stronger, smarter, or superior to them in any way. " +
			"They proudly claim kinship to dragons, but beneath all the bluster, the comparison to their glorious cousins leaves kobolds with a profound sense of inadequacy. " +
			"Though they are hardworking, clever, and blessed with a natural talent for mechanical devices and mining, " +
			"they spend their days nursing grudges and hatreds instead of celebrating their own gifts.",

		"-Gnome\n": "-Expatriates of the strange land of fey, these small folk have a reputation for flighty and eccentric behavior. " +
			"Many gnomes are whimsical artisans and tinkers, creating strange devices powered by magic, alchemy, and their quirky imagination. " +
			"Gnomes have an insatiable need for new experiences that often gets them in trouble.",

		"-Orc\n": "-Orcs are aggressive, callous, and domineering. Bullies by nature, they respect strength and power as the highest virtues. " +
			"On an almost instinctive level, orcs believe they are entitled to anything they want unless someone stronger can stop them from seizing it.",

		"-Ratfolk\n": "-Ratfolk are small, rodent-like humanoids; originally native to subterranean areas in dry deserts and plains, " +
			"they are now more often found in nomadic trading caravans. Much like the pack rats they resemble, ratfolk are tinkerers and hoarders by nature, " +
			"and as a whole are masters of commerce, especially when it comes to acquiring and repairing mechanical or magical devices.",

		"-Saurian\n": "-Lost to time The Sauria are a proud reptilian race, they make astounding advanced technologies and used to produce the smartest minds. " +
			"Until they were attacked by the other amphibious creatures, like bullywugs and lizard folk. Afraid that other civilisations would steal their grasp of magic and technology they hid away. " +
			"They let their paranoia get the better of them. They have not been seen for eras. When they are seen in public they get mixed reactions, some treat them like their cousins, " +
			"lizard folk and some study them.",

		"-Skinwalker\n": "-Most people believe skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they share some slight version of the curse of those creatures. " +
			"Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen by nature or the gods to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth may lie somewhere between these two ideas.",
