			"if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic itemâ€™s abilities. If you fail the check by less than 5, " +
			"you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. ",
		"-Bluff\n": "You can use Bluff to pass hidden messages to another character without others understanding your true meaning. " +
			"The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for complex messages. If you are successful, the target automatically understands you, " +
			"assuming you are speaking in a language that it understands. If your check fails by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures " +
			"that hear the message can decipher the message by succeeding at an opposed Sense Motive check against your Bluff result.",
		"-Climb\n": "With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, wall, or other steep incline (or even across a ceiling, provided it has handholds) " +
			"at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees " +
			"or more. A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. ",
